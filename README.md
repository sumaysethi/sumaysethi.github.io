# Sumay Sethi
  My name is Sumay and I am a first year student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I am currently undecided, but I hope to transfer into the business school at some point in time. 
  I was born in Morristown, New Jersey, and grew up in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. I am of Indian origin, and even lived there for three years. I enjoy playing soccer, and am fluent in three languages.

# NCAA Infographic
  This infographic shows the percentage of college athletes who are able to play at a professional level in the four major sports. I think that this is something that interests me because I love sports, and I am interested in sports journalism. I think that this infographic illustrates the harsh reality of college sports, and helps one comprehend that a majority of college athletes do not go pro.

# New York Yankees Timeline
  Baseball is considered to be America's pastime, and the Yankees are the sport's most important team. Along with their numerous championships, over time they have also accumululated a rich history, which one is able to visualize using the timeline below.

# Lehigh Bar Chart
In order to help visualize data, we often use models such as bar graphs to help us understand parts in terms of a whole.

# NBA Bar Chart
In honor of the NBA Finals going on right now, I decided to create a visual model to help show the distribution of championships around the league. In analyzing this data one can see that the league has historically been dominated by two teams: the Lakers, and the Celtics. While many teams like the Spurs, Warriors, and Bulls have had dysnasties themselves, they have not been able to have the consistent production of the Lakers and Celtics.

# 2019 Most Populous Cities in the United States
This map depicts the msot populated cities in the United States as of 2019. While cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago were expected to be on there, cities like San Jose and San Antonio were more surprising. I feel like this puts into perspective the population distribution throughout the country.

# Tableau
I created some bar charts analyzing student behavior when it comes to parties. I focused on preference on location of the parties, and on the mode of transportation to reach these said parties. I specifically targeted the transportation to off-campus parties.
