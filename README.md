# Sumay Sethi
  My name is Sumay and I am a first year student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I am currently undecided, but I hope to transfer into the business school at some point in time. 
  I was born in Morristown, New Jersey, and grew up in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. I am of Indian origin, and even lived there for three years. I enjoy playing soccer, and am fluent in three languages.

# NCAA Infographic
  This infographic shows the percentage of college athletes who are able to play at a professional level in the four major sports. I think that this is something that interests me because I love sports, and I am interested in sports journalism. I think that this infographic illustrates the harsh reality of college sports, and helps one comprehend that a majority of college athletes do not go pro.
