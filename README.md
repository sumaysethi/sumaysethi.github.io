# Sumay Sethi
  My name is Sumay Sethi an I am a first year student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I am currently undecided, but I hope to transfer into the business school at some point in time. 
  I was born in Morristown, New Jersey, and grew up in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. I am of Indian origin, and even lived there for three years. I enjoy playing soccer, and am fluent in three languages.
